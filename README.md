# DynamicLinqExamples
Examples injecting custom types and methods into Framework System.Linq.Dynamic or Core System.Linq.Dynamic.Core


Thanks goes to the people over at https://github.com/zzzprojects/System.Linq.Dynamic from which I was able to track down the CreateClass method that makes some of these examples possible.

Thanks goes to the larger community of developers and developer hubs who published articles related to this topic.

And thanks goes to Microsoft for the System.Linq.Dynamic.Core Api and for the System.Linq.Dynamic Api.

I cannot definitively list sources I pulled ideas from in my lengthy searches to tackle this issue.
